      <p><em>2006 inkjet print (189 cm × 122 cm) &mdash; edition of 3</em></p>
      <p>
        This print reproduces seven hundred and fifty digital images of mugs that
        were online, on one day, in the endeavour of their owners to sell the mugs
        depicted on eBay. In many instances I was the first and subsequently the
        only person to view the enlarged version of the image online. It represents
        not only a social and economic portrait, through the collectible aspects
        of a tea-drinking nation, but is also a visual statement upon the subject
        of appropriation of digital imagery, this physical reproduction existing
        beyond the digital originals now extant.
